  The UN specification requires the total flows from ODA and Other Official Flows (OOF) for aid for trade, which is not available here.  The flows covered by OOF are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries. These additional flows
  cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed in the CRS codes but exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/ CRS codes. The reported indicator only covers the ODA part, so it is likely an underestimation.

  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare
  of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. ODA
  recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.<p>Country income classification - The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of countries eligible to receive ODA is based on Gross National Income per capita as published by the <a
  href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a>. All low and middle income countries are included, with the exception of G8 members, EU members, and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as
  defined by the <a href = "https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/least-developed-countries%20">United Nations (UN)</a>.<p>LDCs - Least Developed Countries<p>LMICs - Lower-middle Income Countries<p>UMICs - Upper Middle Income Countries<p>Other LICs - Other Low Income Countries<p>Undefined -

  Aid for Trade is captured by the Broad Sector Code 331. The net ODA across these codes is summed for the headline UK data. These sums are broken down into the different recipient country income classifications outlined in the definitions. The Broad Sector Code field and other relevant
  disaggregations are available from the Data Underlying SID spreadsheets linked in Source 1. The constant USD conversion was done using methodology specified by the <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114943-what-is-your-constant-u-s-dollar-
  methodology">World Bank<a/>. In this case the average 2020 exchange rate was used as a base (obtained from Source 2).
