indicator_available: Number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 maternities, and number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births
national_indicator_description: These data show the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. This differs from the UN metadata which asks for the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate).

national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: Rate per 1,000 live births
computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Neonatal death - The death of a child when the age of the child is under 28 days.</p><p>Early neonatal - The death of a child when the age of the child is under 7 days.</p><p>Late neonatal - The death of a child when the age of the child is between 7 and 27 days.</p><p>Region - Region
  of usual residence, not region of occurrence.</p><p>Country - Country of occurrence.</p><p>Age - Age of the mother.
available_disaggregations: <p>Figures for the UK are only available for the headline data and for sex.</p><p>Neonatal period - Figures are given for early, late and overall neonatal period for all characteristics.</p><p>Country - Country of occurrence. The separate figures for England and Wales exclude deaths of non-residents. The figures for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales combined include deaths of non-residents. They should thereofe not be directly compared to the separate figures for England and Wales. The UK figure is calculated as the sum of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales combined.</p><p>Region - Region of residence (note that this differs to Country, which is area of occurrence). Region is only available when 'England' is selected in the Country dropdown menu.  Figures are based on boundaries as of May 2020.  </p><p>Age - Age of mother. Only available when England an Wales is selected in Country. Available in conjunction with birthweight (under 1000, under 1500, and under 2500). More detailed data are available in Table 10 of the <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/childmortalitystatisticschildhoodinfantandperinatalchildhoodinfantandperinatalmortalityinenglandandwales">Child mortality (death cohort) tables in England and Wales</a>.</p><p>Birthweight - Only available when England an Wales is selected in Country. Birthweight is given in grams. Grouped birtweight is available by age of mother (see note in 'Age' above).</p></p><p>Country of birth - Mother's country of birth. Only available when England an Wales is selected in Country. Available in conjunction with sex (until 2018).</p>Sex - Sex of the baby.<p>Figures for age of mother, birthweight and mother's country of birth are only given where deaths could be linked to their corresponding birth registration record (above 95% for all years).

We have not presented these figures here due to the level of uncertainty in many of the figures.<p> Data on further characteristics are also available from the <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/childmortalitystatisticschildhoodinfantandperinatalchildhoodinfantandperinatalmortalityinenglandandwales">Child mortality (death cohort) tables in England and Wales</a>.
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>Where neonatal mortality rates were not provided in the source data, the following calculation was carried out </p><p>(Number of neonatal deaths / number of live births) * 1000 </p><p>Late neonatal mortality rates were caluclated as Neonatla mortality rate - Early neonatal mortality
  rate.</p>
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  Rates based on fewer than 3 deaths are not shown. Due to the small number of events, the reliability of rates which are based on between 3 and 19 deaths may be affected. This particularly affects rates for late neonatal deaths, and for certain categories in country by sex, and age of
  mother by birthweight. Please check the source data to identify these points.

  <p>Important information on the strengths and limitations of the data, the quality of the output, uses and users, and how the output was created are given in the <a
  href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/childmortalitystatisticsqmi'>Child and infant mortality Quality and Methodology Information document</a>.</p><p> Where the number of deaths is smaller than 3, rates are not given.
  </p></p>Some figures shown have low reliability (rates based on between 3 and 19 deaths). Information on reliability is given in the observation status column in the downloadable csv. In particular, late neonatal figures have low reliability for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland by sex,
  some birthweights and some Country of birth levels. Reliability is also low in some Country of birth categories - figures for Antarctica and Oceania, and Rest of Europe (no-EU) have low reliability for all neonatal periods. Early and late neonatal figures for the Americas and the
  Caribbean also have low reliability.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
