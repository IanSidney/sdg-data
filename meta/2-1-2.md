  <p>Household - The definition of a household used in the FRS is ‘one person living alone or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room, or dining area’. So, for example, a group of students
  with a shared living room would be counted as a single household even if they did not eat together, but a group of bed-sits at the same address would not be counted as a single household. A household may consist of one or more benefit units, which in turn will consist of one or more
  people (adults and children).  </p><p>It should be noted that the food security section of this publication excludes shared households (see definition below), such as a house shared by a group of professionals. These respondents may not have insight into the food security status of
  others in their household and may not regularly share financial information. </p><p> Shared household - The definition of shared household being used in the FRS is 'a household where the household reference person is unclear or arbitrary, such as a group of students, unrelated adults
  etc., where the household is being shared on an equal basis'. Households where adult children are living with their parents or where there are lodgers, but the owner lives in the household, are both not considered shared households for the purposes of this definition. <p>  The head of
  household (also referred to as the household reference person within the FRS) is either -
  <li>  The sole householder (i.e. the person who owns or rents the accommodation)</li>
  <li>  If there are multiple householders, the person with the highest personal income from all sources</li>
  <li> Or if multiple householders have the same income, the eldest</li> <p><p>  Disability Status - The [(GSS) harmonised "core" definition](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/) identifies a person as disabled if they have a
  physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-
  to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability
  Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.

  1. Data for Chinese and Bangladeshi ethnicities are not available due to small sample sizes (Less than 100). 2. For respondents in Great Britain, 'Gypsy or Irish traveller ' is included in the 'White' ethnic category. For Northern Ireland respondents, 'Irish traveller' is included in the
  'Other ethnic group' category. 3. For the data reference year the state pension age for men and women was 64 years 8 months.

  <p>Data presented here come from the Family Resources Survey run by the Department for Work and Pensions. This includes a suite of food insecurity questions. This series of questions is asked of the person in the household who knows the most about food purchasing and preparation. There
  are a range of questions, asking about the household adults within the household, and the person answering the questions. The questions do not directly ask about the food security status of children. Answers are used to generate a household food security score. The score is equal to the
  number of 'positive' answers -  'yes', 'often true' or 'sometimes true' (or '3 days or more', depending on the question). Taking all answers together, households are assigned a food security status, based on their score -.
<ul> 
<li>High food security (score = 0): The household has no
  problem, or anxiety about, consistently accessing adequate food</li>
<li>Marginal food security (score = 1 or 2): The household had problems at times, or anxiety about, accessing adequate food, but the quality, variety, and quantity of their food intake were not substantially reduced
  </li>
<li>Low food security (score = 3 to 5): The household reduced the quality, variety, and desirability of their diets, but the quantity of food intake and normal eating patterns were not substantially disrupted </li>
<li>Very low food security (score = 6 to 10): At times during the
  last 30 days, eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake reduced because the household lacked money and other resources for food</li></ul>
</p><p> Households with high or marginal food security are <q>food secure</q>. Food secure households are
  considered to have sufficient, varied food to facilitate an active and healthy lifestyle. Households with low or very low food security are <q>food insecure</q>. Food insecure households have a risk of, or lack of access to, sufficient, varied food.
</p><p>Further information on the
  questions posed can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020/family-resources-survey-background-information-and-methodology"> Background Information & Methodology</a> </p> It should be noted that, unlike some
  pieces of research, the FRS Household Food Security questions cover the 30 days prior to interview, not the previous 12 months, as this better fits the context of other FRS questions. This means that caution may be needed when making direct comparisons between the FRS results and other
  studies on this subject. </p> The broad structure and sequence of the questions is the same as those used internationally. They are used within the UK (Food Standards Agency) and are also used by other countries and are based on the <a>
  href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/media/8279/ad2012.pdf">United States Department of Agriculture </a>, enabling broad international comparability of the results. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK
  data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
